# ðŸ¤– Spring AI + OpenRouter: The Universal LLM Gateway

This repository demonstrates how to integrate **OpenRouter** with **Spring AI**, allowing you to access hundreds of Large Language Models (LLMs) from providers like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and many more through a single, unified API. This project showcases the power of switching between different AI models by changing just one line in your configuration file, with zero code modifications.

## ðŸ’¡ About This Project

This project implements a simple **Smart Chat Assistant** to demonstrate the ease of integrating OpenRouter with Spring AI. It showcases how to:

*   Configure Spring AI to use any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.
*   Use a single `ChatClient` to access a vast array of models.
*   Switch between different LLMs (e.g., from a free model to a paid one like GPT-4o) just by editing the `application.yml` file.

The application exposes a simple REST endpoint that takes a user's message, sends it to the configured model via OpenRouter, and returns the AI-generated response.
